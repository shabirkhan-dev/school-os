# School OS

> **The trust engine for schools. Peace of mind for parents.**

School OS is a **mobile-first, Apple-polished** school management platform built on one premise: **parents want to know their child is safe, and schools want to prove it.**

It is **not a generic ERP**. It is a **trust and communication engine** for affordable private schools (roughly 200–2,000 students) — starting with **Smart Attendance** and WhatsApp alerts, then expanding into communication, academics, finance, and AI-assisted teaching tools.

This repository is the **production monorepo** for that product: Bun, Turborepo, Next.js, Expo, NestJS, optional FastAPI AI assist, shared packages, Docker, and CI.

## The killer demo

```text
Teacher scans a student's QR code at the school gate.
→ Within seconds, the parent's phone buzzes on WhatsApp:
  "Rohan has arrived safely at school. 8:17 AM."

Principal's dashboard updates in real time:
  247 students in · 3 absent · 1 late
```

That loop — **scan → parent alert → live dashboard** — is Phase 1. Everything else builds on that trust signal.

---

## Core philosophy

| Principle | What it means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| **Trust first, ERP second** | Every feature answers: *How does this build trust between school and parent?* |
| **Mobile-first** | Teachers and parents live on their phones. Design for **WhatsApp**, not email. |
| **Apple-level polish** | Zero training required. Smooth, intentional, beautiful interactions. |
| **Privacy by default** | Encrypted data, consent tracking, audit logs — especially for minors. |
| **AI assists, humans decide** | AI drafts and flags; policy checks and approvals gate high-impact actions. |
| **Built for the exit** | Clean modules, tenant-safe APIs, documentation — ready for acquisition or white-label. |

**Research-informed messaging (2026):** Use the official **WhatsApp Business Cloud API** (not personal WhatsApp or unofficial gateways). Collect explicit parent opt-in, route all minor communication through guardians, prefer **utility templates** for transactional alerts, respect quiet hours, and let schools tune frequency (exception alerts vs. weekly digests) to avoid notification fatigue.

---

## Who it's for

| Persona | Primary device | Core pain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **School owner / principal** | Laptop + phone | *Are parents happy? Are admissions up? Is staff accountable?* |
| **Teacher** | Phone (often Android) | *Attendance takes forever. Parents keep calling. Reports are manual.* |
| **Parent / guardian** | Phone (WhatsApp) | *Is my child safe? Did they reach school? What's the homework?* |
| **Student** | Phone | *What's due tomorrow? Did I miss anything?* |

## Product modules (roadmap)

| Phase | Focus | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 — Foundation** | Monorepo, auth, design system | ✅ In progress — see [Built today](#built-today) |
| **1 — Smart Attendance MVP** | The hook | QR check-in, scan UI, WhatsApp/SMS/email alerts, principal dashboard, parent feed |
| **2 — Communication & academics** | Retention | Announcements, teacher–parent chat, homework, timetable, report cards |
| **3 — Finance & AI** | Revenue + moat | Fees, Razorpay/Stripe, AI report comments, early warnings, bus GPS, admissions CRM |
| **4 — Polish & scale** | Exit-ready | UX audit, white-label, performance, demo videos, enterprise isolation |

Detailed backend phases: [production-roadmap](http://localhost:3002/docs/production-roadmap) · Full architecture: [product-system-design](http://localhost:3002/docs/product-system-design) · Vision brief: [product-vision](http://localhost:3002/docs/product-vision)

### Smart Attendance (Phase 1 detail)

| Feature | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| QR check-in (phone or card) | Fast gate flow — no special hardware |
| Multi-channel alerts (WhatsApp, SMS, email, push) | Parents get peace of mind on the channel they use |
| Departure + absentee auto-notify | Closes the safety loop; cuts truancy |
| Late arrival log | Discipline with data, not guesswork |
| Bus attendance + GPS (later) | Premium safety and upsell |
| Exportable reports | Saves teachers hours vs. paper registers |

Face recognition stays **optional and off by default** until consent, legal review, and a pilot require it.

---

## Built today

The monorepo is a **production-shaped foundation**. Domain modules from the spec are mostly **planned**, not shipped yet.

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Monorepo (Bun, Turbo, Biome, Lefthook, CI) | ✅ |
| Web admin shell + marketing (`apps/web`) | ✅ |
| Expo mobile scaffold (`apps/mobile`) | ✅ |
| NestJS API spine — auth, sessions, MFA, passkeys, profiles (`apps/nest-api`) | ✅ |
| Billing hooks — Stripe / Razorpay (`apps/nest-api`) | ✅ |
| AI assist proxy — FastAPI (`apps/ai-api`) | ✅ |
| Docs site (`apps/docs`) | ✅ |
| **Attendance, tenants, students, WhatsApp pipeline** | 🔜 Phase 1 per roadmap |

---

## What's in the box (technical)

| Surface | Stack | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Web** | Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind 4 | Admin dashboard, marketing, auth, billing |
| **Mobile** | Expo SDK 57, Expo Router, NativeWind | Parent, teacher, guard, bus workflows |
| **API** | NestJS 11, Drizzle, PostgreSQL / Neon | Production backend spine |
| **Docs** | Fumadocs + MDX | Product and engineering documentation |
| **AI assist** | FastAPI (optional) | Proxied by Nest — never public-facing LLM keys |
| **Rust demo** | Axum (optional) | Reference binary / experiments |

Shared packages (`@school-os/ui`, `@school-os/logger`, TypeScript configs), Docker Compose, Dev Container, Lefthook hooks, and CI/CD pipelines are included out of the box.

### Positioning vs. the detailed spec

| Topic | Portfolio spec | This repo (source of truth) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | FastAPI or Hono / Express | **NestJS** — modules, guards, queues, WebSockets |
| Database | PostgreSQL + SQLite cache | **PostgreSQL** (Neon in prod); Redis planned for cache/queues |
| AI | OpenAI / Ollama | **FastAPI** behind Nest proxy; human approval for high-risk actions |
| Messaging | Twilio / WhatsApp Cloud API | Planned via notification engine + outbox worker |
| Payments | Stripe / Razorpay | **Stripe + Razorpay** providers in `nest-api` billing module |

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) `1.3.13` · Git · optional Docker Compose `v2.20+` and Rust (for `apps/rust`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shabirkhan-dev/school-os.git
cd school-os
bun install
bun run prepare   # install git hooks (recommended)
bun run dev
```

| App | Dev URL |
| --- | --- |
| Web | http://localhost:3000 |
| Nest API | http://localhost:4000 — `/api/v1/health`, `/api/docs` |
| Docs | http://localhost:3002/docs |

Run a single app:

```bash
bun --cwd apps/web run dev
bun --cwd apps/nest-api run dev
bun --cwd apps/mobile run dev
bun --cwd apps/docs run dev
```

Before pushing changes:

```bash
bun run lint && bun run format && bun run typecheck
```

**Core product loop (target):**

```text
Student arrives → attendance event → parent alert → live dashboard → AI risk signal
```

**Engineering loop (target):**

```text
Write to Postgres + outbox in one transaction → worker delivers notifications & realtime → idempotent, auditable side effects
```

Import boundaries and naming rules: `bun run architecture:check`.
