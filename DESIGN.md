# Design System Brief

This file is the source of truth for AI agents and humans when creating UI in this School OS.
Keep it updated before generating new screens with Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, v0, Open Design,
Figma MCP, Onlook, Scamp, or similar tools.

## Product Intent

School OS is a **trust engine for schools** — mobile-first, WhatsApp-native, starting with Smart
Attendance and parent alerts. Generated UI must feel domain-specific (school operations, not generic
SaaS), accessible, responsive, and built from reusable components.

## Audience

- Developers starting new products from this monorepo.
- Designers or product builders using AI tools to explore screens.
- AI coding agents implementing UI from product briefs, Figma frames, or design-system prompts.

## Visual Principles

- Prefer clear hierarchy over decoration.
- Prefer operational density for dashboards, admin panels, and internal tools.
- Prefer calm, readable surfaces for documentation and product workflows.
- Avoid generic SaaS hero sections inside actual applications.
- Avoid decorative blobs, glassmorphism, nested cards, and one-note purple/blue gradients.
- Use real state design: loading, empty, error, disabled, hover, focus-visible, selected, saving,
  success, and permission denied.

## Layout Rules

- Use stable dimensions for toolbars, sidebars, tables, cards, and repeated controls.
- Do not let text overflow buttons, tabs, cards, table cells, or mobile headers.
- Do not place cards inside cards unless it is a true repeated item or modal body.
- Keep desktop workflows scannable and mobile workflows thumb-friendly.
- Use responsive constraints instead of viewport-scaled font sizes.

## Tokens

The shared Tailwind 4 design tokens live at `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` (shadcn monorepo style).

Current baseline:

- Background: `--background`
- Foreground: `--foreground`
- Primary: `--primary`
- Secondary: `--secondary`
- Muted: `--muted`
- Border: `--border`
- Ring: `--ring`
- Radius: `--radius`
- Charts: `--chart-1` through `--chart-5`
- Sidebar tokens: `--sidebar-*`

When adding a new app, do not invent one-off color systems. Extend the shared token package or
create an app-specific override with a short rationale.

## Typography

- Use the app's configured sans font for product UI.
- Reserve large display text for true first-viewport marketing or documentation hero sections.
- Use smaller, tighter headings inside dashboards, cards, sidebars, tables, and forms.
- Keep letter spacing at `0` unless a specific brand treatment requires otherwise.

## Components

The repo has a shared web primitive package at `packages/ui` and app-local primitives in
`apps/web/src/components/ui`.

Current rule:

- Use `@school-os/ui` for stable shared primitives such as `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, form fields,
  `Separator`, `Skeleton`, and `Textarea`.
- Keep complex or app-specific composed components inside each app or feature module.
- Promote a component to `packages/ui` only after it is reusable and free of route/auth/data
  coupling.
- Add Storybook or a docs route later for visual review of shared components.
- Add examples for loading, empty, error, disabled, hover, focus-visible, and selected states.

## AI UI Generation Rules

Before implementing UI, an agent should:

1. Read this `DESIGN.md`.
2. Read the target app's README and existing components.
3. Identify reusable components and tokens.
4. Ask for missing product context if the screen purpose is unclear.
5. Propose an implementation plan before editing.

After implementing UI, an agent should:

1. Run lint/typecheck/tests for the touched app.
2. Capture or inspect desktop and mobile rendering where possible.
3. Check long text, empty data, error states, and keyboard focus.
4. List any intentional differences from the design reference.

## Prompt Template

```txt
Use DESIGN.md and the existing app components as the source of truth.

Design/implement [screen/component].

Audience:
[who uses it]

Primary task:
[what the user must complete]

Domain constraints:
[data density, privacy, accessibility, workflow, device context]

Required states:
loading, empty, error, validation, hover, focus-visible, selected, disabled, saving, success

Quality bar:
No generic SaaS layout. No decorative blobs. No nested cards. Use shared tokens, stable spacing,
accessible contrast, responsive behavior, and existing component conventions.

Before coding, return:
1. Components to reuse.
2. New components needed.
3. Token changes if any.
4. Tests or visual checks to run.
```
